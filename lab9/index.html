    <h1 id="title">Lab 9 Javascript Events and Forms</h1>
    <button id="btn">Click me!</button>
    <div id="hover">
    <h2>Hover over me to change my color.</h2>
    </div>


    <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p>The challenge I had was making sure the javascript code was in the right place. </p>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
        <p>I missed the class period when event listners were taught and I need to catch up, I brefily taught myself from my partner codes.</p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
        Both of my events work. My button to hover over changes the text and background color. And the click me button adds a border to the title.
