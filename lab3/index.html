			<th><p id="p1">The selected game is the card game: War. Task 1 describes pseudocoding the card game War. The questions our psedocode will answer are:
			<br>1. What actions are take in War?<br>
			•Playing and battling a card, taking the losers card, and repeating.
			<br>2. What do I need to remember or keep track of?<br>
			•Remembering the rules of the game.
			<br>3. What I do over and over again?<br>
			•Playing a card from your pile.
			<br>4. When do I need to make decisions?<br>
			•Deciding a victor for each battle.
			</p></th>
			<th><p id="p1">
				•Players shuffle deck and split it<br>
				•Each player flips one card over from their pile of cards<br>
								•The players compare their card value to one another<br>
										•If player 1 has a higher valued card then player 2, player 1 wins that “battle”. Vice Versa.<br>
										•If the players tie, the players flip another card over and compare those. The victor of that “battle” wins all pairs of tied battles.<br>
						•The players continue this loop until each player's deck pile runs out.<br>
				•The player with the most battles won (more cards) wins the game.<br>
